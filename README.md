# SmartProcure Developer Interview Project

## Motivation and expectations

The goal of this project is to do a collaborative code review. We want you to showcase your strengths in a real world context, so be ready to explain your code and your decisions. The exact subject matter is up to you - take it as far as you'd like. We'll spend about an hour together going over it.

**If you already have a side project or something open source you can share, feel free to use that!** A pre-existing passion project, especially if it's close to our tech stack, would be an excellent submission. Since many great developers don't have that, this project acts as a reasonable alternative. Some developers will choose to do this even if they have an awesome side project to fill in some skill gaps - there's no harm in having more than one project to discuss. An ideal project would use our tech stack, but the most important thing is communicating your competencies.

## Ideas and Examples

Something this open ended can be exciting, but you might not know where to start. A simple example would be to build a simple CRUD app using featherjs, create-react-app, and mobx-autoform. Bonus points for adding search UI using contexture. You can use feathers-memory to avoid setting up an actual database. If you're aiming for full stack, properly indexed mongo collections will go a long way. If you're much stronger on the react side, doing something awesome in react with custom inputs might be compelling, too.

With that said, keep in mind that we want you to explain your code and decisions. It might be wiser to use something you're more familiar with (even if it's outside our tech stack) so you can fully explain your reasoning than stretch to use new things you don't fully understand. The best applicants will use our things _and_ fully understand them, but err on the side of competence over completeness.

### Sample Subjects

This isn't designed to test creativity or novelty, so here are some example ideas if you're having trouble coming up with something:

- A lunch suggestion app where you can add restaurants and it picks one
- A game (anything is fine)
- More things... :)

- feathersjs
- mongodb (w/ native mongo driver)
- react (w/ create-react-app)
- mobx
- mobx-autoform
